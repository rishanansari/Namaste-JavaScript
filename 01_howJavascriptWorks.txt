How javascript work?

Everything in JS happens inside an execution context.

Execution Context-> Two component : memory component(variable environment) and code component(thread of execution).

memory component -> It contains variable and function as key value pairs.
code component -> Where the whole code execute.

javascript is a synchronous(specific order) single-threaded(one command at a time) language.
